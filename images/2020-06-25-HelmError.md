If you are on a early version of helm and you try to run helm init on Kubernetes 1.16 or later you get the following error.

` Error: error installing: the server could not find the requested resource `

This happens because kuberentes moved the deployment object from beta to released and so the kuberentes config yaml generated by helm is no longer valid.

The fix is simple download the latest version of the helm client from [https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v2.16.9](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v2.16.9). The latest version of helm 2.16.9 seems to be fine.
