title: "IBM APIConnect WhitePaper 10.0.8.x"
draft: true
---

For the last year a small team and I have been updating the API Connect WhitePaper to cover changes between 10.0.1 and 10.0.8.  

The previous versions of this WhitePaper have assisted clients, IBMers and Business Partners from around the world deploying and understanding IBM API Connect.

For this release we have changed our approach to deployment patterns to ensure that we could accurately show the flexibility of the product while at the same time provide a clear cookbook of options.

Our intention is not to make our audience wait another 2.5 years for the next version, we are intending to update this every few months as new function is provided that makes sense for us to include.
