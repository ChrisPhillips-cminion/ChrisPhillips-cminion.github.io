It's that time of year again when we all search for the perfect gifts for our loved ones. I've always believed in giving something creative and personal—whether it's handmade by my kids or commissioned from talented friends and artists.

This year, I decided to commission a custom family portrait from **Carlos Valarezo**, a talented illustrator based in Ecuador. I provided him with a detailed brief and a collection of family photos, and he transformed them into the stunning artwork you see above.

## About Carlos Valarezo

Carlos is a full-time professional illustrator who specializes in custom commissions. He's married to Josie, who previously designed the theme for this blog and several other projects I've worked on. While I knew Josie's design work well, this was my first time collaborating with Carlos on an illustration project.

## The Commission Process

### Timeline and Communication

I reached out to Carlos in **November 2025** to discuss the project. The process was remarkably smooth:

1. **Initial consultation**: We discussed my vision, agreed on pricing, and established a timeline
2. **Photo submission**: I provided multiple reference photos of my family
3. **Regular updates**: Carlos sent progress updates throughout the project, ensuring the artwork matched my expectations
4. **Refinements**: After my wife saw the near-final version, Carlos made a few minor adjustments to perfect the piece
5. **Final delivery**: High-resolution artwork ready for printing

### What Impressed Me Most

- Excellent communication: Carlos was responsive and proactive in sharing updates
- Collaborative approach: He welcomed feedback and made adjustments willingly
- Professional quality: The final artwork exceeded my expectations
- Reasonable pricing: Great value for a custom, high-quality illustration
- High resolution: The final image (4961 x 3508 pixels) is perfect for large-format printing

## The Creative Journey

Below, you can see the evolution of the artwork from initial sketches to the polished final piece. This transparency in the creative process gave me confidence and allowed for input at key stages.
