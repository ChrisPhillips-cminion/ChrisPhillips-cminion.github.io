title: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
---

Recently I have had a lot of people asking me about why they are getting an error complaining of a unable to connect or a -1 connection error.

This is often Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) error. The role of CORS is to tell the client/browser what is allowed or not allowed on the HTTPs endpoint, it does not do enforcement itself. A client/browser makes an HTTP Options request to the endpoint to find out what it is allowed to do. Providing those headers (below) have been injected into the response this tells the client/browser what it is entitled to do. CORS is not there to add extra protection, it is there rather to provide extra information to the client/browser. Some http libraries such as NodeJSâ€™s request do include an option call prior to the requested call to help enforce this, but it is a client-application decision. If the CORS headers stop the requested operation then a -1 is showing in the error.

This could be due to the operation returning a 404, or an invalid VERB is called.

If you are using API connect and you would like to build a custom set of CORS rules you can do this very easily. Firstly untick the core tick box to stop the default settings being applied. Add the following headers to the response of the options call.
- `message.headers.Access-Control-Allow-Method ` with a  list of allowed verbs
- `message.headers.Access-Control-Allow-Origin` with a list of allowed origin requests
