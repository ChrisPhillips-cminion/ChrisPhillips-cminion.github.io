**UK Star Trek Attack Wing --- Un Nationals 2018**

Sunday the 3rd of June 2018, Fourteen admirals arrived to participate in
a series of War Games to show who is the best commander.

130 pt fleet Limit, with three obstacles of their choice. Four rounds
followed by a top four cut, with a brief break for some Klingon Opera
(Thanks Byron).

With representatives from Scotland, Somerset, Manchester and a local
from Birmingham we got underway.

**Round One**

The Scotsmen went through and won five of the seven games, it looked
like another good year for the guys from Stirling,

**Round Two**

In Round 2 every player got at least a single kill. I have never seen
this in my years playing the game. There was only one player on maximum
(Bryan) after two rounds.

**Round 3**

At the end of round three it was still neck and neck. Anyone from the
top seven could potentially qualify with the top runner Bryan still with
a chance to be knocked out.

**Round 4**

So at the end of the Swis we have our top four. All from Scotland with
Liam from Manchester being just 32 fleet points shy of qualifying. The
final standing after the Swis are below.

The Top four cut saw two of the players from last year, David and Bryan.

**Semi Final**

**David** vs G

and

**Bryan** vs Fergus

Unfortunatley during the semi files the universe started to collapse
(Expo was being packed up) and so I did not record the final scores.

**3rd/4th Place**

Fergus vs **G**

**Final**

**Bryan vs** David

So Bryan for the third year won the UK Nationals with David retaining
his 2nd place. G went from seventh in 2017 to third in 2018.

**Additional Prizes**

In addition to the top eight prizes we shared a participation prizes to
each entry which was a series of resources and prize cards from this
year.

The prize for the highest Pure fleet that did not make the cut went to
Liam and his Daughter Alex

The prize for the highest fleet points that did not make the cut went to
Derek (also a pure fleet)

The Fellowship prize went to a vote where the top four could be voted
for, every single player got at least one vote, but both Derek and Dan
got the most votes,

**A fun day was had by all!**

My key take away points from the event

1\. No Two fleets were the same, or even close

2\. The two pure fleets came in 5th and 6th and both very nearly
qualified for top four.

3\. No one walked away with zero fleet points

4\. At the end of the third round before the top cut any of the top seven
could qualify depending on the outcome of the fourth and final round.

5\. The youngest player was a 7 year old with her Dad (so my daughter is
now in an extensive training regime for next year)
