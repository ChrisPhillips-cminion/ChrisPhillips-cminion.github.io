There has been a facelift!

I hate front end design and implementation. It is not my thing, give me a good CLI any day. However, a good clean design is essential for helping people to navigate and learn from your blob.

My old blog's theme was hastily created in a couple of hours with the intention of refreshing it soon after. Fast forward a year, I had not done anything. So I contacted my good friend Josie to assist. Josie is a freelance graphics designer in Ecuador. She created an awesome mock up which I that spent far too long creating in Jekyll, and what you see here is the result.

If anyone needs an excellent graphics designed please reach out to her,  [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAB6HyzEBZdRvHWVH6AlUJhA_XXxJkyhmkTs?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BjklvrajVQje8MuKg62ZsPg%3D%3D](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAB6HyzEBZdRvHWVH6AlUJhA_XXxJkyhmkTs?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BjklvrajVQje8MuKg62ZsPg%3D%3D)
