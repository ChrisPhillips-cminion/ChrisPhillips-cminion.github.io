When you need to take down a service for maintenance, you need
confidence in knowing that the rest of your APIs and client applications
will continue to run smoothly. How can you be sure when you know the
user list for the service documentation is unreliable and you don't
always know which APIs or applications depend on that service?

client applications that rely on them. This tutorial shows how you can
download and use this tool to help assess your API organizations.
