title: Positive feedback must not be forgotten.
---

When ever I role off a project, I try to call out the good people working on the ground, those unsung heroes who are never noticed because they are too busy doing a good job.

The IT industry is great at just ignoring the excellent work the day to day engineers and project managers do. But we must call them out and sing their praises. Simple things like,
- Engineer X knew how to phone up to escalate all the hardware requirements and delivered early,
- Engineer Y caught a major bug that delayed us two weeks but if we had missed it we would have got into trouble.
- PM Z made sure that that stand ups were only 10minutes long

I have made it a rule that if I am at a customer or IBM project for over two weeks I send out feedback to those who have made the biggest impact on me. I don't include any thing negative, if there is negative feedback that is urgent that gets raised immediately when it happens. This includes emailing the customer and business partners managers about their employees . More then once I had a Business Partner manager tell me they had never received positive feedback before for an employee and didn't know what to do with it.

I am not perfect and I know I will still miss many amazing engineers I have worked with but if i have one cultural change impact on this industry I hope this is it. #peoplemattermost #work
