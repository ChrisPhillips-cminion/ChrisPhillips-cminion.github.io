title: "What goes into a Runbook or SOP?"
draft: true
---

I spent a lot of time advising clients what they need to keep their system operational. The topic of a RunBook / SOP is always interesting. In my experience only 50-60% of clients have one, 30% of clients know what should go int0o one but have not yet written it and 10% of clients don't think they need it.

<!--more-->

A run book has one simple objective.
**The manual to follow to debug and fix a situation that includes  provides all relevant technical and contact information in one place**

This is what the new SREs follow to fix problems, this is used at 2am to ensure experienced SREs don't make common mistakes.  This should also be seen as hand over documentation and instructions for training new team members.

Though I describe this as a single document it is frequently multiple documents that sit together. These are living documents and should be regularly updated as changes or new information occurs.

The table below describes the sections that I would expect to see
