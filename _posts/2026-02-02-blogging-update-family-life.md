I know some of you have noticed I've been publishing less on my blog lately. The reason? Less travel, thanks to these little monsters. 🦖👶

## A Trying Time

2024-2025 has been a trying time. I don't typically share personal stuff on LinkedIn or here on the blog—I prefer to keep things focused on technical content and professional insights. But as 2026 has kicked off, I wanted to share a quick update on what's been happening behind the scenes.

## What's Changing in 2026

The good news is that I've started producing more content again, and I'm excited to say that more contributing authors are joining in. Having additional voices and perspectives on the blog has been fantastic, and I'm hoping this momentum continues throughout the year.

Travel has always been a big part of my work, providing opportunities to connect with teams, attend conferences, and gather material for blog posts. With two young children at home, that's naturally slowed down—but it's also given me a different perspective and new priorities.

## Looking Forward

I'm committed to maintaining a steady flow of technical content, API management insights, and practical guides. The addition of guest authors means you'll get even more diverse perspectives and expertise.

Thank you all for your patience and continued readership. Here's to a productive 2026!

## P.S. A Personal Note

I've also lost a shit ton of weight! Huge thanks to Bryan and Cheryl for this awesome t-shirt. Do they come in Baby Sizes? 💪

P.P.S. Apologies for the terrible photo of me!
