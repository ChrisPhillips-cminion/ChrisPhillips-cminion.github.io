So I am on my way back from API Strat 2018 and I found it brilliant.

I went to this event with the intention of talking to as many people as
possible and attending as many sessions on security as I can.

I presented two sessions

If I can I will share the formal feedback when it is provided. But both
of these sessions brought together some great deep conversations and
debates. One ending up with me in a bar with Microsoft...

My favourite session I attended was [A Tour of Mobile API Protection by
Skip Hovsmith,
CriticalBlue](https://apistrat18.sched.com/event/FTR2/a-tour-of-mobile-api-protection-skip-hovsmith-criticalblue#) . Though I didn't learn anything new, it was the best
delivery of a security refresher that I have seen.

Looking forward to applying to go again next year, and figures crossed I
can present again.
