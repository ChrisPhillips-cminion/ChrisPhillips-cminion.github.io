API Governance is something I have talked about for a long time. Governance is wide topics but today we will cover standards and API Consistency.  I have written a few times about API Consistency and its importance.

 A consistent API estate allows

•	Easier for consumers to start using APIs
•	Easier to detect API Duplication
•	Easier to ensure that the APIs hit a certain quality threshold

The traditional way of solving this was to have Centre of Excellence meetings where changes were manually approved. This was great for keeping consistency but dramatically increased the speed of velocity

The challenge always has been how do you apply your governance rules to provide the consistency required. A governance rule that is not enforced or policed has no value.  	

In API connect 10.0.6.0 CD we have released the first step on their API Governance solution. I was involved in some of the discussions kicking this off and have kept an eye on it as it developed from afar.

Now we can run a series of rulesets against APIs in the draft view. These rulesets can be shared between provide orgs and customised to meet the needs. Out of the box we have several baked in rulesets.
