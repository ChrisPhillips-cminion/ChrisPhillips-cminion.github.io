title: VS Code Alias
---

I have been a vim user for 25years of my 40year life it is my primary editor. I started using Atom along side it five years ago. I am playfully being mocked and so I am starting to learn VSCode.

I use terminals to navigate my filesystem and some one of the things I liked was that i could just type `vim filename` and i can edit a file, or `atom .` and load the directory in Atom. 

**EDIT** - Of course within 10mins of publishing this article I have been told there is a native way of doing this

`Control+Shift+P` and select `Install 'code' command in PATH`

However I am going to keep using the alias for now.

**OLD POST**
So this article is to say I have got this working for vscode on a mac.

By setting this alias  `alias vscode=/Applications/Visual\\\ Studio\\\ Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/code`  I can now do `vscode .`

This is my first blog post written in VSCode with help from WCA.
