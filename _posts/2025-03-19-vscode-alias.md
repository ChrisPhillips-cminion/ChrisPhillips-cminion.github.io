title: VS Code Alias
---

I have been a vim user for 25years of my 40year life as my primary editor. I started using atom along side it five years ago. I am playfully being mocked and so I am starting to learn VSCode.

I use terminals to navigate my filesystem and some one of the things I liked was that i could just type `vim filename` and i can edit a file, or `atom .` and load the directory in atom. 

So this article is to say I have got this working for vscode on a mac.

By setting this alias  `alias vscode=/Applications/Visual\\\ Studio\\\ Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/code`  I can now do `vscode .`

This is my first blog post written in VSCode with help from WCA.
