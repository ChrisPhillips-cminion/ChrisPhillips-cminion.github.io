# Mock Backend Services with User Defined Gateway Policies

This article was published on **IBM developerWorks.** For the complete article please go here [https://developer.ibm.com/apiconnect/2017/05/11/mocking-backend-services-gateway-policies/](https://developer.ibm.com/apiconnect/2017/05/11/mocking-backend-services-gateway-policies/)

Testing your API implementation is critical, but not always easy. Sometimes your backend services aren’t set up to handle the load of testing. Even worse, sometimes backend services go down altogether. API Mocka provides a simple way to stub backend systems, so you can test and optimize your API implementation without relying on direct access to services.

#How API Mocka Works

API Mocka is a set of custom policies for mocking back end services (download from GitHub [here](https://github.com/ChrisPhillips-cminion/APIConnect-Policy-Mocka/releases).) The API Mocka Policies provide you the ability to stub as a service. Coupled with the out of the box set-variable policy, a complete service implementation can be provided very simply.
