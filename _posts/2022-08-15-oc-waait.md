title: Waiting for a pod to start
---

I often write shell scripts to do kick off tasks, wipe databases etc etc.... Im lazy and it means I can kick this off then walk the dog. I recently came across the oc wait command. This allows you to run a command that returns either when a timeout is hit or a kube object goes into a desired state.  The default timeout is 30s

`oc wait --for=condition=Ready=true po  minimum-a7s-storage-data-0 --timeout=300s`

The above command waits for the pod named `minimum-a7s-storage-data-0` to be in a ready state or until five minutes have passed.
