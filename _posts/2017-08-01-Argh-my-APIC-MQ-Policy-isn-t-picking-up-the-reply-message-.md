# **Argh my APIC MQ Policy isn't picking up the reply message.** 

This is a response to the most common question I get from
<http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/mw-1611-hutchinson-trs/index.html>

**Why is the reply message not being picked up?**

The inbuilt DataPower client assumes that the reply (or response
message) must have a correlation ID that matches the Message ID of the
original request message.

If you are an IBMer looking to do a POC with this please ping me and we
can share an asset to support you.
