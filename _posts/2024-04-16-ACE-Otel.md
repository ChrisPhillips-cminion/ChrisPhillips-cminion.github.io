AppConnect Enterprise recommends enabling OpenTelemetry to provide end to end tracing.

This article will explain how to enable it in a new deployment or augment it to an existing deployment in ACE.

## What is OpenTelemetry
OpenTelemetry (OTEL) is an open-source framework for observing traffic as it passes through different stages. IBM Instana recommends this as their preferred method for receiving tracing data from IBM AppConnect Enterprise.

## Paramaters

|---|---|---|
| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
|---|---|---|
| enabled | enables the OpenTelemetry service in ACE | false |
| endpoint | (Optional) Where to send OpenTelemetry data to. If the collector is running as a DaemonSet on default ports this can be ignored | 172.21.181.253:4317 |
| protocol |  (Optional) Forward the data via GRPC or HTTP/Json | grpc |
| tls.secretName | (Optional)  Secret Containing the TLS Cert for securing communication to the collector.  If SSL is not being used this should be left blank or not included in the YAML. | none|
| tls.caCertificate | (Optional)   Secret Containing the CA Cert for securing communication to the collector. If SSL is not being used this should be left blank or not included in the YAML. | none |
|---|---|---|

## Enabling it for new deployments

When deploying a new instance of an IntegrationRuntime you can specify in the UI or the yaml. For the YAML add the snippet in the following section below. From the ACE Dashboard when you go through the wizard to deploy the integration runtime you see the image below.

Once these settings are filled in it will push the data to the collector endpoint.

## Enabling it for existing deployments

The easiest way to enable it for an existing deployment is to edit the IntegrationRuntime object.

`oc edit integrationruntime <object instance name>`

Then add the following code into the existing `.spec` with the correct endpoint and port for the openTelemetry target. If the collector is not secured with tls please omit the `.tls` section.

```yaml
spec:
  telemetry:
    tracing:
     openTelemetry:
      enabled: true
      endpoint: 172.21.181.253:4317
      protocol: grpc
      tls:
        secretName: opentel-ca
        caCertificate: opentel-cert
```

 This can also be done via the ACEDashboard by editing the IntegrationRuntime.
