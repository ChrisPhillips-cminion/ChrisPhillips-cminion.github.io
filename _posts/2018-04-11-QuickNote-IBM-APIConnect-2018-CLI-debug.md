# QuickNote: IBM APIConnect 2018 CLI --- debug 

API Connect released a new major version labelled 2018.

As usual I will write tips and tricks as i find them here, mainly so i
can find them myself.

Today I discovered the nw CLI has a debug flag
(`--debug) `that allows you to see the
rest commands being made to the backend system. This is great for
learning how the Rest API for APIConnect works and for debugging why the
CLI is not doing what you would expect.
