title: "API Connect  - Long Term Analaytics - Now with Rest Interface"
---

API Connect has added facilities to allow you to analyse longer term data. The reporting facility that shipped in 10.0.8 shows reports from the previous 12 months. This is very useful as it can show quickly
* How many calls consumer organization has made
* How many APIs have no subscribers
* How has the call rate and latency changed for an API over the past several months
As well as many other scenarios,

Recently in 10.0.10.0 we have released a rest interface to access this data. - There is a great article here [https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/anagha-biju/2025/06/27/access-long-term-analytics-with-summary-apis-in-v1](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/anagha-biju/2025/06/27/access-long-term-analytics-with-summary-apis-in-v1) where you can learn more about this interface
