### API Connect Impact Analyses --- now evaluates draft Products and APIs 

Just a note to say I have added into the beta stream support for
analysing products in drafts.

When the catalog is selected you can now select drafts as an option.

Please note that there will be no applications subscribed to products
and apis in drafts. Therefore if you select applications as the first
field to sort on, nothing will show.
