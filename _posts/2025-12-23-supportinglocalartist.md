Its that time again, where we all fret what to get our love ones for xmas. I try and get something creative for my wife each year, either made by my kids or by friends.

This year I approached Carlos. I have worked with his wife before, she designed the theme for my blog and a few others but Carlos is an illustrator. I gave him a spec, a load of photos and he produced the masterpiece above.

Carlos is based in Ecuador and is married to Josie.

Carlos is a fulltime illustrator open to commissions, and works for very reasonable rates. If you would like to do something unique for a loved one please contact him through [https://www.behance.net/carlosvalarezo](https://www.behance.net/carlosvalarezo) or feel free to send me a message and I will link you up.  

For this commission, I contacted him back in November and we agreed a price. I sent him a lot of photos. As he went along and he sent me updates as he went to ensure that what he was doing was to my liking. Great communication, and a great result. After my wife saw it, he made a couple of tiny alterations.

The final delivery was an image with the resolution 4961 x 3508, which should be suitable to print to a good size. Below are some of the images of the journey.
