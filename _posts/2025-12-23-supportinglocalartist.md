Its that time again, where we all fret what to get our love ones for xmas. I try and get something creative for my wife each year, either made by my kids or by friends. Of course I do pay for it if its by friends.

This year I approached Carlos. I have worked with his wife before, she designed the theme for my blog and a few others but Carlos is an illistrator. I gave him a spec, a load of photos and he produced this master piece.

Carlos is based in Ecuador and is married to Josie.

Insert photo.

Carlos is a fulltime illistrator open to commisions, and works for very reasonable rates. If you would like to do something unique for a loved one please contact him through (https://www.behance.net/carlosvalarezo)[https://www.behance.net/carlosvalarezo]  or feel free to send me a message and I will link you up.  

For this image, I contacted him back in November and we agreed a price. I sent him a number of photos. As he went along and he sent me updates as he went to ensure that what he was doing was to my liking. Great communication, and great result. After my wife saw it we made a couple of tiny changes.

The final delivery was a an image with the resolution 4961 x 3508, which should be suitable to print to a good size. Below are some of the images of the journey.
