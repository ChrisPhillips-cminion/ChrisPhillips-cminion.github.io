Alongside Aiden Gallagher I put together the API Connect WhitePaper for 2018.4.1 

The document can be downloaded from https://developer.ibm.com/apiconnect/2019/02/08/api-connect-v2018-deployment-whitepaper-now-available/

The paper covers the following main topics:

* API Connect Component Diagram
* Introduction to define terminology and personas
* API Connect components overview
* Deployment options including Kubernetes and appliance options
* Terms and naming conventions including API development, API topology, consumer components, and the Developer Portal
* Isolation and environment segregation covering API providers, API consumers, Gateways, and the Developer Portal
* Deploying for high availability
* Multi-Data center deployment patterns
* Kubernetes deployment considerations
* Kubernetes storage considerations
