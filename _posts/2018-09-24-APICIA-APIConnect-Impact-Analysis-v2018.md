I have just dropped a beta for API Connect IA for v2018.

This now runs in seconds where the previous version ran in minutes. It
depends on v2018.3.x of API Connect.

The ASCIINEMA Demo is available here
<https://asciinema.org/a/Inj1YuPPL8Rfwjjl62J2zXsKE>

If you would like to have play have a clone of the beta branch of my
repo

This does not yet match parity to the v5 version so be aware of the
following

1.  [Does not work with v5]
2.  [Does not provide applications or subscription]
