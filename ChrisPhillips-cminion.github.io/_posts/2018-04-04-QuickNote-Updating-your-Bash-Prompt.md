title: 'QuickNote: Updating your Bash Prompt'

<!--more-->
There are a million guides out there but as I always googled this I
thought I would post the answer here.

Simple set the PS1 environmental variable in to .bashrc
or .bash\_profile

```
PS1=’#[\D\] $(whoami)\e[0m \e[1m$PWD$/ \e[0m >>> ‘
```

this gives me

> \#\[2018--04--04 08:45:21\] cminion /home/cminion\$/ \>\>\>

Where

```
\D\ -  provides the date
$PWD$ - provides the pwd output
whoami - provides the current user
```

Note: that if you use commands like date or pwd in there it will take
the first value when the PS1 is set (i.e. when a new bash prompt is
opened).
