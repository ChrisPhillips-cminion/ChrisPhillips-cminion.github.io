title: "Installing OpenShift 3.11  Again Part - 1"
draft: true
---
<!--more-->
_So Jeff has gone to a better place. My many year old ATOM that I was using as one of the nodes and bootstrap server for OpenShift 3.11. Its CPU was clocked at 80'c and then overnight it never returned._

Jeff held my inventory file (config file) for my openshift and with the passing off Jeff (and his disk) I have lost the file and all notes I had made.

The purpose of this series of Articles is to document my install process of OKD on Fedora 29 (Linux distro). OKD is the OpenSource version of OpenShift.  I want OKD over K8s or K3s because it is the K8s platform of choice by all big businesses.  However as I have stated many many times before I am not an infra guy. I am happier at the application layer and above.

I will document hopefully using ASCIINEMA everything I do in the  hope that it will help someone else hitting these same issues.

My environment will consist of
| | Description | OS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| random |  32GB Ram 16 vCPU - Master, Compute, Infra | Fedora 29 Workstation  |
| banana |  32GB Ram 8 vCPU - Compute | Fedora 29 Server  |
| randomstore |  8GB (16gb When i find some RAM) RAM 4 vCPU, Compute | Fedora 29 Server  |

This is NOT an HA environment, as much as I would like an HA environment I cannot get away with any more machines being on 24/7


I have got SSH Keys working between the environments and correctly set up the hostnames.


I have cloned the ansible playbook repository to /opt/src and checked out 3.11


This is my initial inventory file that I have put into /etc/ansible/hosts
