title: DataPower ExtLatency Log Renderer
---
<!--more-->

My nephew joined me for a couple of weeks at IBM Hursley as his work
experience.

In the UK 15yo do two weeks work experience as part of their education.
My nephew arrived with some Python knowledge and quickly introduced him
to Stack Overflow, i.e. the developers toolbox.

The week before he arrived I had to analyse some DataPower extLatency
logs for a large company. I spent a few hours turning them into a pretty
graph so I could quickly understand what was going on.

I asked my nephew to produce something similar in python. This took in a
text based extLatency file and rendered the output as below.

The code has been released here
<https://github.com/ruling11ghs/DP-EXD-Latency-Graph>Â . As ever I am
always looking for feedback for both myself and my nephew.
