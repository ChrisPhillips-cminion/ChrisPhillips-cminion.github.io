### How do you track who is calling IBM Watson when they don't have business reason? Answer: Use APIÂ Connect!

I recently authored a blog post with [Charlotte
Hutchinson](https://medium.com/u/bbd8359f304e) on using API Connect to protect external services.

IBM API Connect is often used to control access to downstream systems
and expose a business's internal services to the outside world for
consumption. But what if you wanted it the other way around? What if you
wanted your API to expose external services to internal developers? API
Connect can be used to simplify access to external services, too.

Take IBM Watson services for example. If you aren't familiar with IBM
Watson, it's a cognitive system enabling a new partnership between
people and computers. IBM Watson has a number of exposed APIs for
analysing and processing data, making it a great candidate for
demonstrating the usefulness of exposing external services for internal
consumption.
