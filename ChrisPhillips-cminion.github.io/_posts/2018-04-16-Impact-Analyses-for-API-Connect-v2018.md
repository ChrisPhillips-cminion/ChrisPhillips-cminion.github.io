title: Impact Analyses for API Connect v2018
---
<!--more-->

So I have been asked when the Impact Analysis tool will work on 2018 of
API Connect.

I have spent a couple of hours reworking the tool so it can support both
v5 and v2018. Where as on v5 it takes a few minutes to run on v2018 it
takes seconds!

I have a few things to sort out before this is ready to be uploaded but
its on its way.
