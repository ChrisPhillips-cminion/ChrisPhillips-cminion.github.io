title: 'QuickNoteÂ : Network not working on ubuntu cosmic'
---


I installed ubuntu cosmic and upgraded so everything was on the latest
package in the ubuntu repos.
<!--more-->
I rebooted and then the onboard network card failed to get an IP. Now
this is not a guide on how to debug it, but just how i fixed it.

This is not my first rodeo and so I have a USB wifi card sitting in my
box of cables just for these occasions. Once I plugged it in decided to
try the original kernel. A quick reboot later everything was working
fine. So it was a problem with the 4.18.11 kernel.

So I looked at how to patch to 4.19.1 to see if this fixed the problem
and I came across UKUU from this link
(<https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/02/ukuu-easy-way-to-install-mainline-kernel-ubuntu>)

This awesome app gives me a standalone interface for controlling which
kernels i have installed and installing the latest. I used the app to
install 4.19.1 did a reboot and everything worked fine.
