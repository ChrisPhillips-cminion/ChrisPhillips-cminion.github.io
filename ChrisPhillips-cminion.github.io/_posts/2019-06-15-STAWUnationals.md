 The first week of June is the [UK Games Expo](https://www.ukgamesexpo.co.uk/). For the last three years I have judged the UK Star Trek Attack Wing National Championships. Sometimes these are official this year unfortunately it was not.
<!--more-->
 Star Trek Attack Wing Unnationals has never been the busiest game but we had 11 players across the UK, including returning three time national champion Bryan G.

_Note: While watching the videos of this event you may have seen two things that may not appear quite right. This is a friendly tournament where want to test the skill of the players not the players ability to pack. Dan flew two Klingon B'rels that appeared to be permanently cloaked because of breakages on route. Also Byron lost one of his dials after arriving at the show. All players agreed that neither of these problems should stop them from playing._

# Special Mentions

### Shug (Fellowship award)

Shug was voted the best player by everyone winning the fellowship award. Though we had a tiny prize pool this year I always like to give out a fellowship award equal to first place.

Secondly no one has ever in my history of playing this game had such excitement of being awarded a bye. I was generally shocked by the size of the smile and the jumping for joy. (He needed a cigarette I found out later)

### David

David every year makes full use of of his 3d printer and prints a load of tokens and donated a complete set of his token holders for the game. This year I awarded the token holders to Alex for the great dice rolling she did for her dad.

### Byron

Byron arrived with his fleet sheet, including an entire dosier on his ships and his opponents ships, highlighting entry points and week spots. I felt he had done the perfect amount of planning.

### Peter Clark

Though Peter once again was full of excuses for not making it, Peter  donated a number of the prizes. Peter is the prize master for the Stirling CGG and always goes out of his way to find prizes for events running. He does this volenteerly and often out of his own pocket.
