title: "Enabling API Connect Gateway Service Logs in DataPower"
---

*Thanks to Sara Hagger*

DataPower is the gateway/runtime for API Connect. In order for API Connect to synchronise APIs with the Gateway it uses a new DataPower piece of function called the API Connect Gateway Service. When you deploy DataPower in Kubernetes with APIC UP a special log target is configured to store the API Connect Gateway Service logs. However on all other forms of DataPower this is needs to be enabled.

### Viewing the log

If you follow the steps below or you are using DataPower by deployed by APICUP the log file will be available in logtemp:///gwd-log


### Via the Cli

Log into the cli either directly via the console or ssh. Run the following commands, where the domain containing the API Connect Gateway Service is called apiconnect.

```
top; configure; switch apiconnect; logging target gwd-log
      type file
      format text
      timestamp syslog
      size 50000
      local-file logtemp:///gwd-log
      event apic-gw-service debug
    exit
write memory
```
