[IBM® Watson®](https://www.ibm.com/watson/) is an AI platform that helps businesses to uncover
insights, engage in new ways, and make decisions with more confidence.
The numerous Watson APIs both analyze and process data. [IBM API
Connect™](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/api-connect) provides a way to control back-end systems, such as
the ones you run inside your organization or services that you run on
[IBM
Bluemix®](https://console.bluemix.net/?cm_sp=dw-bluemix-_-mw-1707-phillips-bluemix-_-article).

This tutorial demonstrates how you can expose the Swagger file for IBM
Watson as an API in API Connect. By having access to Watson APIs in API
Connect, you can control and track usage of how your organization is
using Watson.

The steps in this tutorial use the Watson Language Translator API as an
example. However, you can use these steps for any Watson APIs.
