Your company has just bought DataPower X2 appliances.  The datacenter that they will be installed in is remote and you have been asked to put together a plan to remotely do their setup.  This article will provide instructions and guidance on what is needed for a minimal setup to get the appliance on your network and accessible via the DataPower WebGUI.

### DataCenter Prerequisites

* DataPower appliance
  * Installed in a rack
  * Ethernet cables plugged in.
  * If your DataCenter has a Serial over LAN like Cyclades, the Cyclades cable is plugged in and the baud rate is set 115200.  This is a change from XI52s, XG45s and XB62s.
* Laptop
  * USB Serial cable that came with the appliances.
  * Program like PuTTY to initialize the appliance with the following values:
    * Baud rate:                115200
    * Data bits:                8
    * Stop bits:                1
    * Parity:                None
    * Flow control:        None
  * Refer to this technote for more information,

### Required DataPower Appliance Setup Information

| **Information Requested** | **Example** | **Actual Value** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Port that will configured.   | Values could be:  mgt0, mgt1, eth10 |   |
| IP Address of one of the ports.  It must be in CIDR format. | 172.16.51.138/24 |   |
| Gateway IP address of the above IP address | 172.16.51.2 |   |
| Admin password.  Recommend initially something simple. | admin123 |   |



### Initializing the Appliance

**Notes:**

* The screen shots are from a virtual appliance.  The prompts are the same except the interface name.
* The settings are not saved except the admin password until the license is accepted.

**Power up the appliance to the login prompt**

* With the following connections at a minimum:
  * One ethernet connection
  * Serial connection.  Either through a Serial Console server or the USB Serial cable connected to a laptop.

  * Enter `n` for no to enable DHCP.
  * Input the IPv4 address for the interface in CIDR format.
  * Input the IPv4 address for default gateway.

  * Select `n` to the remaining interfaces.
* Enter `n` for no until you get to the RAID drive step, Step 6.

  * Enter `y`  for yes to configure the RAID array
  * Enter `y`  for yes to continue
  * Enter the name for the file system.  The default is ondisk.
  * Determine whether or not to enable B2B storage.  If you are not installing the B2B Module, Enter `n` for no as the answer to this should be no.  Otherwise, Enter `y`  for yes.

* Enter `n` for no to review the current configuration
* Enter `y`  for yes to save the configuration
* Enter `y`  for yes to overwrite the previously saved configuration

* Enter `co` to enter the configuration mode.
* Enter `web-mgmt <<IP address>> 9090` to start the Web-GUI where IP address is the IP address of the interface configured earlier.
* Enter `ssh <<IP address>>` to start SSH where IP address is the IP address of the interface configured earlier.
* Enter `write mem` to save the configuration.
* Enter `y`  to overwrite the previously saved configuration.
