title: 'ISTIO --- 404 when curling to confirming the app is running.'
---
<!--more-->

So I spent a few hours this morning trying to get the ISTIO sample
running to see if i can rewrite some of my home micro sevices using
ISTIO.

```
curl -o /dev/null -s -w “%\n” http://$/productpage`
```

When i ran the above command i got a 404.

The GATEWAY\_URL that is generated from the commands listed on the page
were provided was incorrect.

If you do not have a Load Balancer run

```
kubectl get endpoints --all-namespaces | grep ingress
```

this returns

```
istio-system   istio-ingressgateway                    192.168.99.218:80,192.168.99.218:15030,192.168.99.218:15011 + 4 more...    40m
```

This will show you the IP and Port for the Gateway URL. in the example
above it is 192.168.99.218:80

As I have proven many times in the past I am terrible at reading
documentation so I am sure this is documented somewhere. However I am
sure I am not the only one.
