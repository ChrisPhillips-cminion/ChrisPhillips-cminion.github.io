title: 'QuickNote: Command to join new worker node'
---
<!--more-->

```
sudo kubeadm token create --print-join-command
```

When you want to add a new worker node to a k8s master just run the
command above on the master and it will give you the exact command to
run on the new worker.

Saves a LOT of hassle.
