When you need to take down a service for maintenance, you need
confidence in knowing that the rest of your APIs and client applications
will continue to run smoothly. How can you be sure when you know the
user list for the service documentation is unreliable and you don't
always know which APIs or applications depend on that service?

Now, you can use the API Connect Impact Analysis (APICIA) tool to help
you understand these dependencies between your services and the APIs and
client applications that rely on them. This tutorial shows how you can
download and use this tool to help assess your API organizations.
