Just a small update to say we have added support to export as CSV and
save the output as files.

--- --- CSV will generate CSV output

--- --- file \<file path\> will save the output object

This allows you to export data so it can be loaded into excel. The file
option will work with any other options and prints the response to both
the screen and to a file.

These changes are currently only in the beta stream until I have
completed some more
testing.<https://github.com/ChrisPhillips-cminion/APIConnect-ImpactAnalysis/tree/beta>
