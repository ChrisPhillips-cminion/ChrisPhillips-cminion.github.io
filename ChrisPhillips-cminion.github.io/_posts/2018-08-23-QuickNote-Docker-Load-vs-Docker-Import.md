title: 'QuickNote --- Docker Load vs Docker Import'
---
<!--more-->

As usual here is what I have been burnt with today.

Docker import and Docker load from a brief glance do the same thing,
however there is one big difference.

Docker import does not include the cmd to imitate the container. Docker
load does. I am unsure if there is anything else. This means that when
you run a docker image that has been imported you need to specify the
exec command. In kubernetes this will give you a CreateContainerError.

so instead of

`docker import package.tgz customname:customtag`

use

`docker load -i package.tgz`

and then retag the image if required.
