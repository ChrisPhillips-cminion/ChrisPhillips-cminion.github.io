API Connect 2018 comes with a much better CLI then version v5. The
interface is similar but its easier to install and much quicker to run.







------------------------------------------------------------------------




However, one of the biggest stumbling blocks is that when you log in you
need to specify a realm

**TLDR**: Use the following command

`apic login -s <server> -u <username> -p <password> --realm provider/default-idp-2`

**Long Version**

The realm tells the api manager whether you want to log into the
`admin` (Cloud Manager) or
`provider` (APIM Manager) and which user
registry to use.

To get a list of realms you can run the following command, you do not
need to log in first.

`apic realms -s <server> --scope [provder|admin]`

Note: you need to specify if it is a provider or the admin you are
trying to access

You can construct the realm string for the login command using

`[provider|admin]/<realm>`
