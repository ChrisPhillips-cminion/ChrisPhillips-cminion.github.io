Testing your API implementation is critical, but not always easy. Sometimes your backend services arenâ€™t set up to handle the load of testing. Even worse, sometimes backend services go down altogether. API Mocka provides a simple way to stub backend systems, so you can test and optimize your API implementation without relying on direct access to services.

## How API Mocka Works

API Mocka is a set of custom policies for mocking back end services (download from GitHub [here](https://github.com/ChrisPhillips-cminion/APIConnect-Policy-Mocka/releases).) The API Mocka Policies provide you the ability to stub as a service. Coupled with the out of the box set-variable policy, a complete service implementation can be provided very simply.
