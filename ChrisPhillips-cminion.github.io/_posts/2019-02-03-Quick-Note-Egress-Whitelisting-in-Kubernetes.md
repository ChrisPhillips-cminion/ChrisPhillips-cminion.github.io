title: 'Quick Note --- Egress Whitelisting in Kubernetes'
---


I got bored flying back from Germany last week and so I tried to solve a
problem our test team were hitting. They needed to whitelist access to
the internet for all the pods of one application
<!--more-->

I had wanted to play with K8s network policies for ages, finally I got
an excuse.

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: foo-deny-external-egress
spec:
  podSelector:
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
      cidr: <IP to WhiteList>/32
    ports:
      - port: 443
        protocol: TCP
  - ports:
    - port: 53
      protocol: UDP
    - port: 53
      protocol: TCP
```
