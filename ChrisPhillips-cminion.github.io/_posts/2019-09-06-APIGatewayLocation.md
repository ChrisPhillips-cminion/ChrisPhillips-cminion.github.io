The API Gateway can be placed in a DMZ or it can be placed behind the DMZ with a reverse proxy in front of it. Here we will discuss the pros and cons regarding each option.

There is no right answer to this question as it depends on the requirements and procedures of the organisation.

### Option 1 - Gateway behind DMZ

Pros

-   Latency between subsystems between the Gateway and other API Connect Subsystems will be minimal
-   Container environment is isolated from outside world
-   Clear separation of responsibility between API Connect team and other teams.
-   Fewer ports need to be opened between the DMZ and private network.


Cons

-   Reverse proxy must be provided in the DMZ to route traffic to the Gateway.
    -   This is already required for exposing the Developer Portal.
-   If Security policies require SSL Termination in the DMZ, MTLS is not possible using the API Connect functionality.

### Option 2 - Gateway in the DMZ

Pro

-   Production proven technology IBM DataPower Gateway Virtual Appliance
-   Reverse Proxy is not required for routing API traffic.
-   Can be used as a reverse proxy for the Developer Portal.
-    If Security policies require SSL Termination in the DMZ, MTLS is possible using the API Connect functionality.

Con

-   Three virtual DataPower appliances are required
-   Additional latency between Gateway and other API Connect Subsystems
-   Additional bidirectional firewall ports must be opened between the Gateway and other API Connect Subsystems

### Summary

| Requirement    | Option 1                           | Option 2                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Latency        | MIN                                | MAX                                                                                                                                      |
| Kubernetes     | Everything in a Kubernetes Cluster | For Management-Analytics-Portal in one Kubernetes cluster, Gateway is either in its own Kubernetes cluster or not deployed to Kubernetes |
| Firewall ports | MIN                                | MAX                                                                                                                                      |
| Endpoint Type  | API endpoint is reverse proxy      | API endpoint is Load Balancer in front of  the Gateway                                                                                   |  

### My opinion

If there were no requirements or policies impacting my decision I would go with Option 1. There is no technical advantage of one over the other, however less firewall ports need to be opened into the DMZ and it provides a clear separation of responsibilities.

### Additional

Though in this article we have discussed putting the API Gateway into the DMZ, no other API Connect component should put in the DMZ.

### Thanks

Thanks to my two Co Authors for reminding me of this question and allowing me to reuse their pros and cons.
