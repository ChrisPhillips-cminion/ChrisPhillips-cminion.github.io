I was asked what was the best way to hide all the system messages when
an action occurs in Drupal. This was for the API Connect Developer
Portal which uses Drupal as the CMS.

If we take the image above we want to hide the messages that appear in
the green box.

This assumes that the Rules module is already installed into your
drupal.

The module required to add this action to drupal can be found here.

Once loaded a new action will be available in the Rules engine.
