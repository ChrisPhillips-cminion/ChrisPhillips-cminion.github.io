In January I finally broke 1500 views a month of my blog. Though this does not sound like a lot, it was my target for 2019.  

However I was getting more annoyed with Medium. Medium is an amazing platform for articles and discovering content. However I wanted to have more control and to be able to play with more tools. With medium you are locked into their eco system.  If you just want to produce content it is fine, but I wanted to play more.

Someone told me to take a look at Jekyll and after some painful moments, I love it. In addition the ability to host it on github for free is a nice bonus.

The core purpose of my blog has not changed away from being my notebook of problems and how I solved them.  Though I will occasionally post Guest posts for friends who dont have time or motivation to set up their own blogs.

The silence on here for the last three months has primarily been while I selected a new platform. I have a fair amount of content I want to write up.

Now to find the time....
