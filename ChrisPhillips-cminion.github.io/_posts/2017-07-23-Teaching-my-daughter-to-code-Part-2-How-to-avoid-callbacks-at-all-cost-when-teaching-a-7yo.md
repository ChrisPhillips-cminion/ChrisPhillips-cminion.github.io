    Teaching my daughter to code Part 2 --- How to avoid callbacks at all
    cost when teaching a 7yo
---
<!--more-->

So Jessica finally persudaded that we should do some more work on her
quiz. She wanted ot make it interactive so that people could answer the
questions.

*As any half decent coder will say, thats simple!*

*As any decent coder will say, hang on she is 7 and this is Node JS!*

The rules I set myself for this were as follows

```
Rule 1 - Don't mention callbacks
Rule 2 - If she gets bored let her go and do something else.
```

Every time I have done user input at the CLI I have used the *great*
inquirer package
([https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), even writing an extension when it wouldnt do what i
wanted (<https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer-orderedcheckbox> with 12
whole downloads!).

This time I used the simple read package
(<https://www.npmjs.com/package/read>). This allowed us to a very basic
prompt.

```
read({
  prompt: "??"
}, function(err, answer) {
  if (answer == "Prince Philip") {
    console.log("Correct!");
  } else {
    console.log("Wrong");
  }
})
```

So we would console.log to ask the question then run read with a '??' to
prompt for the answer. This would give the following

```
1    How many dogs does the Queen have?

?? ANSWER GOES HERE
```

However to ensure that the questions do not get asked at the same time
(damn Async) we must ensure that each question is asked in the same
callback as we process the answer, ARGH Remember Rule 1. The solution to
this was to not talk about the close braces until we had answered all
the questions.

Once we managed to add the close braces we installed atom-beautify and
Jessica used the magic beautify funciton to make code easier to read.
The final code is in Git
(<https://github.com/ChrisPhillips-cminion/JessicasQuiz>) and below.

Jessica asked a question why do we need aÂ ; at the end of each line. The
only reason I came up with was *"To Stop Jack moaning at me", but she
seemed to accept this.*

**\*\*We make no promises that the answers to the questions are
correct!\*\***

So whats left

1.  [Validating the questions]
2.  [Functions]
3.  [Better callback practise]
4.  [Documenting Code as we go!]
