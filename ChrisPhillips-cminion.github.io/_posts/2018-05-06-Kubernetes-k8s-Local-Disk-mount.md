title: 'Kubernetes (k8s) --- Local Disk mount'
---
<!--more-->

So I have spent far to long trying to mount a local disk into my k8s
cluster. My aim is to run [pihole](https://pi-hole.net/) on my home system in k8s, primarily to educate me.

So after a night out (maybe with some alcohol) and an old friend John he
suggested I look at the latest beta which contains local. He also talked
me into buying a server rack from ebay but that is another story.

I have got my head around helm and so I was keen to keep using it. I
copied and pasted the pv into my local helm chart.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
   name: }-pv
spec:
  capacity:
  storage: 5Gi
  # volumeMode field requires BlockVolume Alpha feature gate to be enabled.
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete
  storageClassName: local-storage
  local:
    path: /mnt/pihole
  nodeAffinity:
    required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
          operator: In
          values:
            - example-node
```

This ran successfully but the pod would not bind with the pvc. After
hitting my head against the wall for 30mins, i sat down and read the
yaml above.

> kubernetes.io/hostname

So i changed example-node to my hostname and it all magically worked!

**Moral of the story, read the sample config before you use it.**
