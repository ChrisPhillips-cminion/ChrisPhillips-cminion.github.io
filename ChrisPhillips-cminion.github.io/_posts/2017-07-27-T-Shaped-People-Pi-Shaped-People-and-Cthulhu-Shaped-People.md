Edit: Apparently not everyone knows who Cthulhu.

Originally, I was told the technology industry wanted T shaped people.
I.e. Someone who knew a bit of everything but was very deep technically
in one thing.

This moved on to wanting Pi shaped People. I.e. Someone with two
specialties but again broad across the board. This was good because you
needed less people for complex specialists tasks but they had the
appropriate training. However they may not be as technically deep in
some areas as T shaped people.

However the more I work the more I find people have many technical
specialties to different levels. Some of these over lap, sometimes they
are missing the core or basic understanding but can explain the complex
side. This is the modern day Cthulhu shaped person.
