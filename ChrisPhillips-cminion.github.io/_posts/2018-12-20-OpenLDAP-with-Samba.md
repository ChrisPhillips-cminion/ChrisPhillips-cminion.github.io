title: OpenLDAP with Samba
---


So like all good techies I have spent my week off setting up my home
LDAP because I need to ensure my kids (8 and 6) need to learn about
enterprise computing.

OpenLDAP is an Open Source User Registry. Samba is a file sharing system
that allows you to share files across a network. The aim here is to
allow users to log into the samba service with users from the LDAP.

LDAP in K8s was a dream. Backing samba (not running in k8s) on to the
LDAP was a challenge.

This articles assumes you have a working samba not using LDAP and a
working LDAP.

Add the following config to the `/etc/samba/smb.conf`

```
[global]
WORKGROUP=WORKGROUP
passdb backend = ldapsam:ldap://192.168.1.132
ldap suffix = dc=cminion,dc=cf
ldap admin dn = cn=admin,dc=cminion,dc=cf
ldap ssl = no
ldap passwd sync = yes
```

Once you have done this you need to run the following to configure the
password for the admin user.

`smbpasswd -w <Password for the admin dn>`

then cycle the SMB service and you should be good to go

`sudo service smbd restart`
