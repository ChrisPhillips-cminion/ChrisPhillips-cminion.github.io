title: "Bind9 DNS Basics"
---

Today I sat down and installed Bind9 to act as a local DNS server. As this took me far to long I have attached a config similar to my home one explaining the changes I made from the default.

<!--more-->

To install bind on centos/rhel/fedora use the following command


```
yum install bind bind-utils -y
```

The following are based on default configs. If no file is present create one. 


**/etc/named.config**

```
acl goodclients {
    localhost;
    192.168.0.0/24;
};
```
Crate a list of clients who are allowed to access the dns server. This is to avoid the DNS server being used for DDOS attacks.  `192.168.0.0/24` says accept all requests from `192.168.x.x`. I have changed IP ranges for this article.

```
listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; 192.168.0.200; };
```
Enter the IP of the DNS server

```
forwarders {
        8.8.8.8;
        8.8.4.4;
};
```
In order to look up public IP addresses a public DNS Provider must be configured.

```
include "/etc/named/named.conf.local";
```
Continue the config in the specified file

```

Configure the zone for look ups, the directory is stored in `/etc/named/zones/dns.myhome.cf`

```
zone "192.in-addr.arpa" {
    type master;
    file "/etc/named/zones/db.192";  # 192.0.0.0/8  subnet
};
```
Configure the zone for the reverse look ups, the director is stored in /etc/named/zones/db.192

Put your search domain in here.

```
This is the directory of host entries, this can be extended as needed.

**/etc/named/zones/db.192**
This file contains the diretory for allowing reverse lookups, i.e. looking up a hostname from an IP address.

```
            IN      NS      dns.myhome.cf.
200.0.168	  IN      PTR   dns.myhome.cf.
4.0.168     IN      PTR   js.myhome.cf.
```
This has the same structure as the previous file but it contains PTR instead of A records.
