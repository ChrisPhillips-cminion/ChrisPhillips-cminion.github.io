title: 'Quick Note --- Hard Reset from inside the Linux OS'
---



I have been using CEPH a lot recently that has an annoying habit of
knackering disks. To fix this is simple, you do a hard reset and
everything is fine. However in this modern cloud world I do not have
access (or want it) to my vcenter, and the guy in charge is a different
time zone and equally busy.

So from a quick google I cam across this


**Hard reset on linux command line.**

Linux is not Windows XP and if reboot fail you usually still connect by
SSH and do something. This commands will
show...*www.linux-geex.com](https://www.linux-geex.com/hard-reset-on-linux-command-line/ "https://www.linux-geex.com/hard-reset-on-linux-command-line/")[](https://www.linux-geex.com/hard-reset-on-linux-command-line/)


These instructions say a hard reset can be done by doing the following

> *echo 1 \> /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq*
> *echo b \> /proc/sysrq-trigger*

And they work like a charm.
