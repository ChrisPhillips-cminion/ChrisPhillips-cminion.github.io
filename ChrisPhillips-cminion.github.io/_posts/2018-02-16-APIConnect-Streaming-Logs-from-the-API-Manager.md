title: APIConnect Streaming Logs from the API Manager
---
 <!--more-->

Recently we were debugging an infrastructure "situation" and we did not
have an external log source set up. The postmortem was failing and the
cmc.out was wrapping far too quickly.

I knocked together this script to allow us to stream the log files from
the API Manager to the local disk.

**THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO BE USED OUTSIDE OF EXTRAORDINARY
CIRCUMSTANCES.**

The Log Tailer simple creates one or more SSH sessions and runs the
following command.

```
debug tail file <filepath>
```

It then writes the file to the local disk.
