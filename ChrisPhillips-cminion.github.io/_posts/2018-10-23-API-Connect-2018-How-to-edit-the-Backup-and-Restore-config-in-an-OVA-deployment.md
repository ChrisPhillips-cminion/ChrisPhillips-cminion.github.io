    API Connect 2018 --- How to edit the Backup and Restore config in an OVA
    deployment
---
<!--more-->

Recently we got asked how do we enable back up of the API Manager in an
API Connect OVA deployment that is already running.

[Rob Thelen](https://medium.com/u/e3752a478e37) acquired the following steps.

1.  [SSH into an API Management OVA]
2.  [Run the following command to become root `sudo su -`]
3.  [Run `kubectl get cc` to get the
    name of the API Connect CC object]
4.  [Run `kubectl edit cc <name> `e.g
    `kubectl edit cc r264f70e7bf-apiconnect-cc`]
5.  [Modify the spec.backup section so it is similar to below]

```
spec:
  backup:
    args:
      host: <SFTP_HOST>
      path: <DEST_PATH>
      port: <SFTP PORT>
      protocol: sftp
      retries: 5
      secretName: sftp-user-pass
      schedule: ""
```

e.g.

```
spec:
  backup:
    args:
      host: cminio.cf
      path: /backup
      port: 22
      protocol: sftp
      retries: 5
      secretName: cassandra-backup-auth-secret-6f2d51587cf14798c0f18e7b7ea07594
      schedule: ""
```

6\. If the secret does not exist for the ftp user then run the following
command

`kubectl create secret generic sftp-user-pass — from-file=./username — from-file=./password -n <KUBE_NAMESPACE>`

7\. Run the following command on your local system to complete a backup
`apic backup create`
