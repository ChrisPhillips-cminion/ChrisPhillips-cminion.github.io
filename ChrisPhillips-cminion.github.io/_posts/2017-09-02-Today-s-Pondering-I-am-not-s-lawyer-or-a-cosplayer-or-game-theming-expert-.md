Do professional cosplayers (I.e. those who get paid for being a
cosplayer) have to adhere to licensing rules?

So if I get paid to attend a convention as a cosplayer and I decide (not
paid to by Disney) to dress up as Princess Elsa do I have the same legal
paperwork as if I were to make a game containing the Disney Character?
