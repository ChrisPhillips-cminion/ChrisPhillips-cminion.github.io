Thanks to Chris Dudley for providing this information

When upgrading the developer portal additional logs can be found in
/var/log/syslog and /var/log/devportal/site\_action.log

The following command will print them to the screen while the upgrade is
taking place.

```
sudo tail -F  /var/log/devportal/site_action.log /var/log/syslog
```
