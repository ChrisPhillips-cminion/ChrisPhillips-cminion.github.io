title: 'One Month on Jekyll'
---
 I moved to Jekyll running on Github about a month ago from medium.

Medium was reporting about 1500 page views per month, Google Analytics is now reporting 4330.  I am somewhat shocked that this has tripled when I have posted the same amount as at my peak on medium.  Media.net has also said i have earned $0.37. Given my overhead is close to zero, this means I am in profit.

I am enjoying writing posts in markdown though I still have some teething issues getting used to the layout.

*Overall I feel my move to Jekyll was a success and currently I have no regrets about moving away from medium.*
